This is a 6502 proccessor emulation written for a university project in C++ - it is intended to be used in a future NES emulator,
however only official opcodes were currently implemented.

To verify the correctness of the implementation, the "nestest.nes" test was used, in its binary form, along with its log file "nestest.log".
These files were obtained from https://www.emulationonline.com/systems/nes/roms/nestest_bin/ - I have no rights over these files, but I include them
so that the project can be properly verified.
